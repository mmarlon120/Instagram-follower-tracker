# Instagram-follower-tracker
The point of this program is to be able to get a list of followers and unfollowers as well as your net gain or loss of followers. I may expand its functionallity in the future but for now this is its goal.

## Prerequisits
You will need Instaloader initialized in your computer for this program to work. Here is the github page for Instaloader to get yourself set up.
```
https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader
```

## What is this useful for?
I want to get this program running for being able to manage and understand your instagram page better and be able to get more information out of what you're given. 

## But Why?
This is my first Repo and I want to learn as much as I can. So posting this and working on it consistently is a good way to learn this.

## Future of this project.
My main priority is to find a way to have instaloader play nice with Instagram itself as because of the nature of this project instagram tends to block this program from working. I may need to connect a vpn of some kind for this project to function consistently. If I keep this project up I will most likely add more functionality to this program to track more data within instagram if possible. I really don't have a plan for this besides just playing with it

I love you Dylan <3
